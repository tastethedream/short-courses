# What the flexbox

## Flexbox alignment and centering with justify-content - video 6

### Justify-content

- How the items aligned along the main axis

- `flex-start` is the default and begins at the left hand side of the container

- `flex-end` begins at the right hand side of the container

- `flex-center` will align the items in the centre of the container without margins

- `space-between` first item will be at `flex start` and the last item will be at `flex end` and the rest will be evenly spaced with eqaul space between

- `space-around` first item will be at `flex start` and the last item will be at `flex end` and the rest will be evenly spaced with equal space between but will also give space at the left and right margins

if you change the direction to `flex: column;` you need to add a min height to the container to get the space
